# üå§Ô∏è GoOutside ‚Äì Your Daily Environmental Dashboard

**GoOutside** is a modular data engineering project that collects, processes, analyzes, and visualizes real-time weather, air quality, and pollen data. Ideal for generating insights or forecasts about when it's best to go outside.


## üìä Key Features

- Automated data ingestion from public APIs (weather, air quality, pollen)
- Raw data stored in a **Google Cloud Storage** data lake (JSON)
- Processed with **Apache Spark** and stored as Parquet
- Modeled into clean **BigQuery tables** using **dbt**
- Machine learning model trained on environmental features
- **Orchestrated with Airflow**
- Interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit**
